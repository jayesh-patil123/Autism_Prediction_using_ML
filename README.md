The Project Title: " Autism Prediction using Machine Learning "

Objective: Develop a predictive model to identify Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning algorithms.

Data Processing: Handled class imbalance using SMOTE, performed data cleaning (e.g., renaming country names, removing irrelevant columns).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted univariate analysis, distribution plots, and outlier detection using box plots.

Feature Engineering: Processed categorical variables with Label Encoding and optimized numerical features.

Modeling & Evaluation: Built and evaluated Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models using cross-validation, RandomizedSearchCV, and accuracy score.

Result: Achieved an effective model for ASD prediction with high accuracy, validated using confusion matrix and classification report.
